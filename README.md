# Demos for Google AIY Kits

**cloudspeech.py** contains fixes for [this speech-to-text error](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/issues/716) on the AIY voice kit. Replace `~/AIY-projects-python/src/aiy/cloudspeech.py` with `cloudspeech.py` to run speech-to-text properly!

**cicada_clock.py** is fun demo that plays cicada sounds and lets you ask "what time is it?"

**cat_cloudspeech_functionality_demo.py** is test code for speech-to-text and button capabilities for the AIY Voice kit.

**cat_cloudspeech_functionality_demo.py** is test code for the AIY Vision kit that uses image classification (modifed from the Joy Detector).
